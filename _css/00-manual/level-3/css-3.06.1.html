        <br />grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular
        expression.
        <br />Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print),
        <br />which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching
        lines.
        <br />Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all Unix-like
        systems.
